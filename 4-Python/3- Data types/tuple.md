### **Tuples in Python**  
A **tuple** is a collection data type in Python that is:  
- **Ordered** (maintains the order of elements)  
- **Immutable** (cannot be modified after creation)  
- **Can store different data types**  

---

### **Creating Tuples**  
Tuples are defined using **parentheses `()`**:
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(my_tuple)  # (1, 2, 3, 4)
```
**Tuples can contain different data types**:
```python~
mixed_tuple = (10, "Python", 3.14, True)
print(mixed_tuple)  # (10, 'Python', 3.14, True)
```

**Single-element tuple (must have a comma `,`)**:
```python
single_tuple = (5,)  # Correct
not_a_tuple = (5)    # This is just an integer!
```

**Tuple without parentheses** (Python automatically treats it as a tuple):
```python
my_tuple = 1, 2, 3
print(my_tuple)  # (1, 2, 3)
```

---

### **Accessing Tuple Elements**
Like lists, tuples support **indexing** and **slicing**.
```python
t = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
print(t[0])   # 10 (first element)
print(t[-1])  # 50 (last element)
print(t[1:4]) # (20, 30, 40) (slicing)
```

---

### **Tuples are Immutable**
Tuples **cannot** be changed after creation:
```python
t = (1, 2, 3)
t[0] = 10  #  ERROR: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```
 **Workaround: Convert to a list, modify, then convert back to a tuple**:
```python
t = (1, 2, 3)
t = list(t)  # Convert tuple to list
t[0] = 10    # Modify the list
t = tuple(t) # Convert back to tuple
print(t)  # (10, 2, 3)
```

---

### **Tuple Operations**
✔ **Concatenation (`+`)**:
```python
t1 = (1, 2)
t2 = (3, 4)
result = t1 + t2
print(result)  # (1, 2, 3, 4)
```

✔ **Repetition (`*`)**:
```python
t = (1, 2) * 3
print(t)  # (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)
```

✔ **Membership (`in`)**:
```python
t = (10, 20, 30)
print(20 in t)  # True
print(50 in t)  # False
```

---

### **Tuple Methods**
Tuples have **only two** built-in methods:  
✔ `count(value)`: Counts occurrences of a value  
✔ `index(value)`: Returns the index of a value  

```python
t = (1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4)
print(t.count(2))  # 3 (because 2 appears three times)
print(t.index(3))  # 2 (index of first occurrence of 3)
```

### **When to Use Tuples Instead of Lists?**
| Feature    | List (`[]`) | Tuple (`()`) |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| **Mutable?** | Yes |  No |
| **Faster?** |  No |  Yes |
| **Memory Efficient?** |  No |  Yes |
| **Use Case** | When data **needs modification** | When data **must stay fixed** |

### **Tuple Unpacking**
You can **assign tuple elements to variables**:
```python
t = (1, 2, 3)
a, b, c = t
print(a, b, c)  # 1 2 3
```

### **Note**
```python
a = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
a = a[::-1] # reassigned anew tuple not the same a in previous 
print(a)
```
