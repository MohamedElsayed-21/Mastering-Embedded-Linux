# ****`select`** Statement in BASH**

The `select` statement in Bash is used to create interactive menus for user input. It simplifies the process of prompting users with multiple choices and executing corresponding commands based on their selection.

## **Syntax of **`select`** Statement**

```bash
select variable in option1 option2 option3 ...; do
    # Commands to execute based on user selection
    break  # (Optional) Exit the loop after selection
done
```

- The options are displayed in a numbered list.
- The user selects an option by entering its corresponding number.
- The selected option is stored in the `variable`.
- The loop continues until explicitly exited using `break` or `exit`.

## **Using **`select`** with **`case`****

`case` is commonly used within `select` to handle user selections efficiently:

```bash
select option in Start Stop Restart Exit; do
    case $option in
        Start) echo "Starting the process..." ;;
        Stop) echo "Stopping the process..." ;;
        Restart) echo "Restarting the process..." ;;
        Exit) echo "Exiting..."; break ;;
        *) echo "Invalid choice, try again." ;;
    esac
done
```

- Each case pattern corresponds to an option in `select`.
- `*)` handles invalid inputs.
- `break` ensures the loop exits when "Exit" is selected.

## **Using **`select`** with **`if`****

`if` conditions can be used inside `select` to control execution based on user input:

```bash
select choice in Option1 Option2 Quit; do
    if [[ $choice == "Quit" ]]; then
        echo "Exiting..."
        break
    elif [[ -n $choice ]]; then
        echo "You selected: $choice"
    else
        echo "Invalid choice, please try again."
    fi
done
```

- `[[ -n $choice ]]` ensures that an empty selection is not processed.
- The loop runs until the user selects "Quit".
