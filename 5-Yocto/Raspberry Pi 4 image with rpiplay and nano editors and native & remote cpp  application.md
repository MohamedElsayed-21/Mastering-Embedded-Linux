## **Yocto Project: A Comprehensive Guide**
### **1. What is Yocto?**

The **Yocto Project** is an open-source collaboration project that provides templates, tools, and methods to help you create custom Linux-based systems for embedded products, regardless of the hardware architecture. Itâ€™s widely used in IoT, industrial automation, and other embedded systems.

---

#### **Core Concepts**
- **BitBake**
   - **BitBake** is the build engine used by Yocto.
   - It reads **recipes** (instructions for building packages) and executes tasks like fetching source code, compiling, and packaging.
   - BitBake is highly customizable and supports parallel builds.

   - **BitBake Workflow:**  

      1. **Create `bitbake.lock`** â†’ Ensures only one instance of BitBake runs at a time to prevent conflicts.  
      2. **Read `build/conf/bblayers.conf`** â†’ Defines which layers (e.g., meta-openembedded, meta-yocto) are included in the build.  
      3. **Read `build/conf/local.conf`** â†’ Contains user-specific configurations like `MACHINE`, `DISTRO`, `IMAGE_FSTYPES`, etc.  
      4. **Read `meta/conf/layer.conf`** â†’ Defines how BitBake should handle each layer, including priority and dependencies.  
      5. **Read `meta/conf/bitbake.conf`** â†’ Core configuration file that sets global variables and paths for the build system.  
      6. **Read `classes/base.bbclass`** â†’ Provides common build functions and settings shared across multiple recipes.  
      7. **Parse `core-image-minimal.bb`** â†’ This is the main recipe for building a minimal image, specifying dependencies and tasks.  
      8. **Execute Tasks (`do_fetch` â†’ `do_unpack` â†’ `do_patch` â†’ `do_configure` â†’ `do_compile` â†’ `do_install` â†’ `do_package` â†’ `do_rootfs` â†’ `do_deploy`)** â†’ Runs each task step-by-step to build the image and generate output files.  
      9. **Remove `bitbake.lock`** â†’ Signals that the build process is complete, allowing future builds to start.
      - run this command  to see the workflow of bitbake 
         ``` bash 
         strace -e trace=openat -f bitbake core-image-minimal |& grep -E ~/Documents/Mastering_Embedded_Linux/5-Yocto/poky/qemu-build | grep -v cache
         ```

- **OpenEmbedded (OE)** is a build framework for creating customized Linux distributions for embedded systems. It provides a flexible, cross-compilation environment with package management, dependency handling, and build automation.

- **Poky** is the reference distribution of the **Yocto Project**. It serves as a build tool and minimal embedded Linux distribution, integrating **BitBake** and **OpenEmbedded** metadata.  
**Poky = OpenEmbedded Core + BitBake + Additional Metadata**  
   - **OpenEmbedded Core (OE-Core)** â†’ Provides base recipes and classes.  
   - **BitBake** â†’ The build engine.  
   - **Additional Metadata (meta-poky, meta-yocto, etc.)** â†’ Adds configurations and customizations.  

- **Layers**
   - **Layers** are directories that contain related recipes, configurations, and files.
   - Layers allow you to modularize your build system. For example:
   - `meta`: Core layer provided by Yocto.
   - `meta-qt5`: Layer for Qt5 support.
   - You can add or remove layers depending on your project requirements.

- **Recipes**
   - **Recipes** (`.bb` files) contain instructions for building a specific package or component.
   - A recipe typically includes:
   - Source code location (e.g., Git repository or tarball).
   - Dependencies (other packages required for building).
   - Build instructions (e.g., `configure`, `make`, `install`).




### **2. Setting Up the Environment**

To successfully build a Yocto-based image for the Raspberry Pi 4, follow these steps to set up your development environment.

- **Install Required Dependencies**

Ensure your system has the necessary packages installed. If you are using Ubuntu, you can install them with the following command:
For more details, refer to the official Yocto documentation: [Yocto System Requirements](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.25/ref-manual/system-requirements.html#ubuntu-and-debian).


```bash
sudo apt install build-essential chrpath cpio debianutils diffstat file gawk gcc git iputils-ping \
libacl1 liblz4-tool locales python3 python3-git python3-jinja2 python3-pexpect python3-pip \
python3-subunit socat texinfo unzip wget xz-utils zstd git inkscape locales make \
python3-saneyaml python3-sphinx-rtd-theme sphinx texlive-latex-extra
```

After installation, ensure that the `en_US.utf8` locale is available by running:

```bash
locale --all-locales | grep en_US.utf8
```

---

### **2. Download and Configure Poky**

Poky is the reference build system for Yocto. To obtain the Poky repository and switch to the desired branch:
[exploring the poky direcotry](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.25/ref-manual/structure.html#source-directory-structure) 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yoctoproject/poky.git
cd poky
git switch kirkstone
```
##### Yocto has multiple releases to ensure stability, introduce new features, and support evolving hardware. It follows a **6-month release cycle**, with some versions being **LTS (Long-Term Support)** for production use (e.g., **Dunfell, Kirkstone**).  

##### LTS releases get **2+ years of support**, while standard releases last ~1 year. Newer versions include updated **kernels, toolchains, and libraries**, while older ones receive security fixes. If you need stability, use an **LTS release**; for the latest features, go with the newest version.
---

### **3. Define the Directory Structure**

For better organization and to avoid modifying the Poky source directly, the following directory structure is used:

```
yocto
â”œâ”€â”€ build-raspberrypi4    # Build directory specific to Raspberry Pi 4
â”œâ”€â”€ downloads             # Shared directory for downloaded source files
â”œâ”€â”€ images                # Output directory for generated images
â”œâ”€â”€ layers                # Custom layers and additional Yocto layers
â”œâ”€â”€ poky                  # Poky source directory (unmodified)
```

##### **Why This Structure?**

- Keeping the `poky` directory separate ensures that upstream changes can be pulled without conflicts.
- The `downloads` directory is shared, preventing redundant downloads when building multiple images.
- Custom layers and meta-layers are placed in `layers`, making it easier to manage and integrate external components.
- Output images are stored in `images`, simplifying access to build artifacts.

---

### **4. Configure Local Build Settings**

Edit `local.conf` in the `build-raspberrypi4/conf/` directory to match the target hardware and improve performance:

```local.conf
MACHINE ?= "raspberrypi4"
DL_DIR ?= "${TOPDIR}/../downloads"
BB_NUMBER_THREADS="5"
PARALLEL_MAKE="-j 5"

hostname:pn-base-files = "Mohamed"
```

 **Explanation of Modifications:**

- `MACHINE`: Defines the target hardware as Raspberry Pi 4.
- `DL_DIR`: Points to the shared `downloads` directory, avoiding redundant downloads.
- `DISTRO`: Custom distribution name, allowing better configuration control.
- `BB_NUMBER_THREADS` & `PARALLEL_MAKE`: Optimize build performance by leveraging multiple CPU cores.
- `hostname:pn-base-files`: Sets the system hostname to "Mohamed".

By following these steps, your Yocto environment is set up efficiently and ready for further customization.

---

### 5. **Initialize the Build Environment**:
   - Run the following command to set up the build environment:
      ```bash
     source poky/oe-init-build-env build-raspberrypi4
      ```
   - This creates a `build` directory and sets up the necessary environment variables.



### **6. Fetch and Add Layers**

ðŸ”— [Understanding and Creating Layers in Yocto](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.25/dev-manual/layers.html#understanding-and-creating-layers)
- **To include additional functionality, fetch and add the required layers:**
   ```bash
   cd layers
   git clone -b kirkstone git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi.git
   git clone -b kirkstone git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded.git
   git clone -b kirkstone https://github.com/meta-qt5/meta-qt5.git
   ```

- **Check dependencies for Qt5:**

   ```bash
   bitbake-layers layerindex-show-depends meta-qt5
   ```

- **Add the layers to the build system:**

   ```bash
   bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/meta-raspberrypi
   bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/meta-openembedded/meta-oe
   bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/meta-qt5
   ```

These layers provide support for Raspberry Pi, additional open-source packages, and Qt5 for graphical applications.
By following these steps, your Yocto environment is set up efficiently and ready for further customization.

- **Edit `bblayers.conf` in the `build-raspberrypi4/conf/` directory :**

   ```bblayers.conf
   BBLAYERS ?= " \
   ${TOPDIR}/../poky/meta \
   ${TOPDIR}/../poky/meta-poky \
   ${TOPDIR}/../poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
   ${TOPDIR}/../layers/meta-raspberrypi \
   ${TOPDIR}/../layers/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
   ${TOPDIR}/../layers/meta-qt5 \

   ```
**Using `${TOPDIR}/..` in `bblayers.conf` makes pathsrelative** **to the build directory, providing key benefits:**

1. **Portability:** The setup works across different machines without modifying `bblayers.conf`.  
2. **Reusability:** Multiple build directories (e.g., for different targets) can share the same layers.  
3. **Yocto Best Practices:** Keeps `poky` and `layers` separate from `build`, following Yocto recommendations.  
4. **Avoids Hardcoded Paths:** Prevents issues when moving the project or using different environments.  


--- 
### **7. Create a Custom Software Layer (`meta-IVI`)**  

To add custom features and configurations, we need to create a new Yocto layer.  

- **Generate the Layer Structure**  
Run the following command inside the **build directory** to create a properly structured Yocto layer:  

   ```bash
   bitbake-layers create-layer ../layers/meta-IVI
   ```
 
This command generates the necessary directories and metadata files required for a valid Yocto layer.  

- **Add the Layer to BitBake**  
Since `bitbake-layers` only recognizes `bblayers.conf` when executed from inside the build directory, switch to it first and Then, add the newly created layer:  
   ```bash
   cd build-raspberrypi4
   bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/meta-IVI
   ```

- **Verify `bblayers.conf`**  
After adding the layer, ensure `bblayers.conf` contains an entry for `meta-IVI`, using **relative paths** to maintain flexibility:  

   ```bblayers.conf
   BBLAYERS ?= " 
   ${TOPDIR}/../layers/meta-IVI \
   ```
**Note:** Always run `bitbake-layers` commands from within the build directory to ensure proper detection of `bblayers.conf`.  


---

### **8. Create Distribution-Specific Layers**  

- **Generate the Layers**  
Run the following commands inside the **build directory** to create the layers:  

   ```bash
   bitbake-layers create-layer ../layers/meta-info-distro
   bitbake-layers create-layer ../layers/meta-audio-distro
   ```

- **Add Layers to BitBake**  
Since `bitbake-layers` only recognizes `bblayers.conf` when run inside the build directory, switch to it first Then, add the layers:  :  



   ```bash
   cd build-raspberrypi4
   bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/meta-info-distro
   bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/meta-audio-distro
   ```

- **Verify `bblayers.conf`**  
Ensure `bblayers.conf` includes the new layers using **relative paths**:  

   ```bblayers.conf
   BBLAYERS ?= " \
   ${TOPDIR}/../layers/meta-info-distro \
   ${TOPDIR}/../layers/meta-audio-distro \
   "
   ```

### **9. Create a Custom Distribution Configuration**  
Now, we will define a **custom distribution** for our project. In Yocto, distributions are typically defined in **configuration files** located under `conf/distro/`.  

### 9.1 - infotainment distro

- **Define the Distribution Configuration**  
Inside the new layer, navigate to its `conf/distro/` directory and create a new file called `infotainment.conf`:  

   ```bash
   cd layers
   mkdir -p meta-info-distro/conf/distro 
   touch ./meta-info-distro/conf/distro/infotainment.conf 
   ```

- **Now, open `infotainment.conf` and define your distribution settings:**  

   ``` infotainment.conf
   DISTRO="infotainment"
   DISTRO_NAME="MOHAMED-infotainment"
   DISTRO_VERSION="1.0"

   MAINTAINER="mohamedelsayedhussein22@gmail.com"

   # SDK Information.
   SDK_VENDOR = "-mohamedSDK"
   SDK_VERSION = "${@d.getVar('DISTRO_VERSION').replace('snapshot-${METADATA_REVISION}', 'snapshot')}"
   SDK_VERSION[vardepvalue] = "${SDK_VERSION}"

   SDK_NAME = "${DISTRO}-${TCLIBC}-${SDKMACHINE}-${IMAGE_BASENAME}-${TUNE_PKGARCH}-${MACHINE}"

   # Installation path --> can be changed to ${HOME}-${DISTRO}-${SDK_VERSION}
   SDKPATHINSTALL = "/opt/${DISTRO}/${SDK_VERSION}" 

   INFOTAINMENT_DEFAULT_DISTRO_FEATURES = "largefile opengl ptest wayland multiarch vulkan x11 bluez5 qt5 "
   # meta/conf/distro/include/default-distrovars.inc -->  DISTRO_FEATURES_DEFAULT ?= "acl alsa argp bluetooth debuginfod ext2 ipv4 ipv6 largefile pcmcia usbgadget usbhost wifi xattr nfs zeroconf pci 3g nfc x11 vfat seccomp"
   DISTRO_FEATURES ?= "${DISTRO_FEATURES_DEFAULT} \ 
                     ${INFOTAINMENT_DEFAULT_DISTRO_FEATURES} \
                     userland  pulseaudio   "

   IMAGE_INSTALL:append=" qttools rpi-play "

   # add systemd as init-process 
   require conf/distro/include/systemd.inc

   # prefered version for packages.
   PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto ?= "5.15%"
   PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto-rt ?= "5.15%"

   # Build System configuration.
   LOCALCONF_VERSION="2"

   # add poky sanity bbclass
   INHERIT += "poky-sanity"

   ```
- **Update `local.conf` to Use the infotainment Distribution**  
Modify `build-raspberrypi4/conf/local.conf` and set ` DISTRO ?= "infotainment"`:  

- **Verify the Configuration**  
   - Run the following command to ensure the distribution is recognized:  
      ```bash
      bitbake -e | grep "^DISTRO="
      ```
   - If everything is correct, it should print:  
      ```
      DISTRO="infotainment"
      ```

---

#### **Enable systemd for Infotainment Distribution**  

##### By default, **Poky uses `sysvinit`** as its **init manager** unless explicitly changed. To switch to **systemd** for the Infotainment distribution, we will include a configuration file.  

For more details on init managers in Yocto, refer to the official documentation:  
ðŸ”— [Yocto Init Manager Documentation](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.25/dev-manual/init-manager.html#using-systemd)  

- **Create the systemd Configuration File**  

   Run the following command inside `meta-IVI`:  
   ```bash
   mkdir -p meta-IVI/conf/distro/include
   touch meta-IVI/conf/distro/include/systemd.inc
   ```
- **Define systemd as the Init Manager**  
Edit `meta-IVI/conf/distro/include/systemd.inc` and add the following content:  

   ```systemd.inc
   # In the past, this variable was used to set systemd as the init manager.
   # It existed in meta/conf/distro/include/init-manager-systemd.inc.

   # Install systemd as the init manager
   # DISTRO_FEATURES:append=" systemd "

   # Select systemd as the init manager
   # VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager="systemd"
   # VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_initscripts="systemd-compat-units"

   # Select busybox-mdev as the device manager
   # VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_dev_manager="busybox-mdev"

   # Just use this variable to set systemd
   INIT_MANAGER = "systemd"
   ```

- **Include systemd in the Infotainment Distribution**  
Modify `meta-IVI/conf/distro/infotainment.conf` and add:  

   ```infotainment.conf
   require conf/distro/include/systemd.inc
   ```

---

### 9.2- audio distro

- **Define the Distribution Configuration**  
Inside the new layer, navigate to its `conf/distro/` directory and create a new file called `audio.conf`:  

   ```bash
   cd layers
   mkdir -p  meta-audio-distro/conf/distro
   touch ./meta-audio-distro/conf/distro/audio.conf 
   ```
- **Open `audio.conf` and define the **audio-specific settings**:  

   ```audio.conf
   require conf/distro/poky.conf

   DISTRO="audio"
   DISTRO_NAME="audio-os "
   DISTRO_VERSION="1.0"

   MAINTAINER="mohamedelsayedhussein22@gmail.com"

   DISTRO_FEATURES:remove = " largefile opengl ptest multiarch vulkan"
   DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " userland pulseaudio bluetooth wifi alsa"
   ```
#### By default, **Poky uses `sysvinit`** as its **init manager** unless explicitly changed. so there is no addition steps here for fullfill the requirment.


- **Update `local.conf` to Use the New Audio Distribution if neededd**  
Modify `build-raspberrypi4/conf/local.conf` and set `DISTRO ?= "audio"`:  
- **Verify the Configuration**  
   - Check that the distribution is correctly set:  
      ```
      bitbake -e | grep "^DISTRO="
      ```

   -  If everything is correct, it should print:   
      ```
      DISTRO="audio"
      ```

---

### **10. Create the Image Recipe: `ivi-test-image.bb`**  

- **Create the Image Recipe File**  

   ```bash
   mkdir -p layers/meta-IVI/recipes-core/images
   touch layers/meta-IVI/recipes-core/images/ivi-test-image.bb
   ```

- **Add the Following Content to `ivi-test-image.bb`**  

   ```ivi-test-image.bb
   require  recipes-core/images/rpi-test-image.bb

   # if you use :append -you have to use it in conf only- you have to leave blank space after `"` and don't leave space before and after `=` .
   #  vice versa in `+=`- in recipes you can use both options :append and += -  you will leave blank space before and after it and not necssary to leave one after `"`

   # inherit audio
   # inherit qtfeatures
   # this feature  alreadey existed in (rpi-test-image.bb --> rpi-base.inc so you don't need to add it again)
   # MACHINE_FEATURES += "wifi bluetooth alsa"

   IMAGE_INSTALL:append=" vsomeip nano c-helloworld cpp-helloworld appssl can-utils "

   IMAGE_FEATURES += " ssh-server-dropbear debug-tweaks tools-debug "



   # Set the root filesystem size
   # IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE = "16384"
   # To run custom commands after the root filesystem is created.
   # ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND += "my_custom_script.sh"


   ```

 **Explanation of the Recipe**  

- **`require recipes-core/images/rpi-test-image.bb`**  
  - Inherits from `rpi-test-image.bb`, meaning it will have the same base configuration.  
- **`IMAGE_FEATURES += " ssh-server-dropbear debug-tweaks tools-debug "`**  
  - Adds features like SSH support (`dropbear`), debugging tweaks, and extra tools.  
  ðŸ”— [Image Features yocto documentaion](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.25/ref-manual/features.html#image-features)  

---

#### **Structure of an Image Recipe in Yocto**  

An **image recipe** in Yocto typically consists of the following components:  
1. **Base Image** (`require` statement)  
   - It defines the core structure of the image by inheriting from an existing base image.  
   - Example: `core-image-base`, `core-image-minimal`, `rpi-test-image`, etc.  
   
2. **Image Features** (`IMAGE_FEATURES`)  
   - Defines additional capabilities like SSH, debugging tools, or package management.  
   - Example: `ssh-server-dropbear`, `debug-tweaks`, `tools-debug`.  

3. **Package Installation** (`IMAGE_INSTALL`)  
   - Specifies additional software packages to be included in the image.  
   - Example: `nano`, `c-helloworld`, `cpp-helloworld`, `appssl`, `rpi-play`.  

4. **Optional Inheritance (`inherit`)**  
   - Some images inherit special classes that modify their behavior.  
   - Example: `inherit core-image` or `inherit audio` (custom class).  

For reference, check the base images available in Yocto:  
ðŸ”— [Yocto Base Images](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.25/ref-manual/images.html)  
ðŸ”— [meta-raspberrypi Documentation](https://meta-raspberrypi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  


#### **Best Practices for Naming Yocto Recipes**  

- **Use the software name** â†’ Match the upstream package (e.g., `nano_6.4.bb`).  
- **Follow `<package-name>_<version>.bb`** â†’ Example: `mytool_1.0.bb`.  
- **Lowercase only** â†’ `nginx_1.22.0.bb`, `NGINX_1.22.0.bb`.  
- **Prefix language-specific recipes** â†’ `python3-requests_2.31.0.bb`, `perl-libxml_0.9.1.bb`.  
- **don't use space** ` ` , use `-` instead of it .
---

### **11. Creating the First Recipe: `cpp-helloworld`**  

#### We are now moving on to creating our first custom recipe for a C++ application. Following the Yocto documentation, we will generate and modify the recipe to meet our project's requirements.  

ðŸ”— [Yocto Writing a New Recipe Documentation](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.25/dev-manual/new-recipe.html#writing-a-new-recipe)

- **Generate the Initial Recipe file**  

1. **Create a directory for C++ recipes**:  
         ```bash
         mkdir -p layers/meta-IVI/recipes-cpp/cpp-helloworld
         ```
      **why this structure necessary?**
   - **Following Yocto's Standard Structure**  
         - Each layer contains a `layer.conf` file, which defines how BitBake finds recipe files.  
         - Typically, `BBFILES` is set like this:  
            ```layer.conf
            BBFILES += "${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bb"
            ```
         - This means Yocto expects `.bb` files to be inside a **subdirectory** within `recipes-*`.  


   2. **Run the following command inside the `meta-IVI/recipes-cpp/cpp-helloworld` layer to create the base recipe:** 
   ðŸ”— [Recpitool Documentation](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.25/dev-manual/new-recipe.html#creating-the-base-recipe-using-recipetool-create)

      ```bash
      cd layers/meta-IVI/recipes-cpp/cpp-helloworld
      recipetool create -o cpp-helloworld_1.0.bb https://github.com/embeddedlinuxworkshop/y_t1.git
      ```

       This will generate a folder named `cpp-helloworld_1.0.bb` with an initial recipe file.  


- **Modify the Recipe**  

   After generating the recipe, edit the `cpp-helloworld_1.0.bb` file and apply the following changes:  

      ```cpp-helloworld_1.0.bb
      # Set the source directory inside the work directory
      S = "${WORKDIR}/git"

      # Define the compilation steps
      do_compile () {
         ${CXX} ${S}/main.cpp -o cpp-app
      }

      # Define installation steps
      do_install () {
         install -d ${D}${bindir}
         install -m 0755 cpp-app ${D}${bindir}
      }

      # Skip package QA checks to avoid errors
      do_package_qa[noexec] = "1"
      ```

---

### **12. Writing a Recipe for a Local Application (`appssl`)**  

this the cpp application , we want to integrate it in out image .
   ```cpp code 

   #include <iostream>
   #include <openssl/sha.h>

   int main() {
      const std::string message = "Hello World";
      
      // Create a buffer to hold the hash
      unsigned char hash[SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH];
      
      // Compute the SHA256 hash
      SHA256(reinterpret_cast<const unsigned char*>(message.c_str()), message.length(), hash);
      
      // Print the hash in hexadecimal format
      std::cout << "SHA-256 hash of \"" << message << "\" is: ";
      for (int i = 0; i < SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH; ++i) {
         printf("%02x", hash[i]);
      }
      std::cout << std::endl;
      
      return 0;
   }

   ```

Since `appssl` is a **local application**, we must use `SRC_URI = "file://appssl.cpp"` to fetch the source code from our local machine instead of downloading it from an external repository.
  [Yocto: Fetching Code in Recipes](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.25/dev-manual/new-recipe.html#fetching-code)
  [SRC_URI](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/bitbake/2.10/bitbake-user-manual/bitbake-user-manual-ref-variables.html#term-SRC_URI)

- **Folder Structure**  
   We follow the Yocto best practices by creating:  
   ```bash
   mkdir -p layers/meta-IVI/recipes-cpp/appssl/files
   ```
   The folder  Structure be like this :

   ``` terminal output
   recipes-cpp
   â”œâ”€â”€ appssl
   Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ appssl_1.0.bb
   Â Â  â””â”€â”€ files
   Â Â      â””â”€â”€ appssl.cpp
   ```
#### The `files/` directory or (  `{BPN}:` â†’ `appssl/` or `${BP} - ${BPN}-${PV}` â†’ `appssl_1.0` ) is necessary for BitBake to recognize and access local source files. 




- **Resolving Dependencies**  
To determine the correct flags for linking against OpenSSL, you can use:  
   ```bash
  $  pkg-config --libs --cflags openssl
   -lssl -lcrypto
   ```
   This helps find the necessary compiler and linker flags.


#### **The Package  Recipe**  

   ```appssl_1.0.bb
   DOCUMENTATION = "appssl"
   SUMMARY = "this appssl app is a simple example of a C++ application with dependencies" 

   LICENSE = "CLOSED"  # Since the app is local and proprietary

   PV = "1.0"  # Package version

   SRC_URI = "file://appssl.cpp"  # Fetch source from local files

   S = "${WORKDIR}"  # Set source directory inside the build environment

   DEPENDS = "openssl"  # Declare dependency on OpenSSL

   do_compile () {
      ${CXX} ${LDFLAGS} ${S}/appssl.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -o appssl
   }

   do_install () {
      install -d ${D}${bindir}
      install -m 0755 ${S}/appssl ${D}${bindir}
   }
   ```

 **Explanation of Variables:**
- **`${CXX}`** â†’ Uses the C++ compiler set by Yocto.
- **`${LDFLAGS}`** â†’ Ensures correct linking flags for the build.
- **`-lssl -lcrypto`** â†’ Links against OpenSSL libraries.
- **`${D}${bindir}`** â†’ Installs the compiled binary into `/usr/bin/` inside the target filesystem.

#### **Understanding `install` Command**  
- The `install` command in Linux is used for copying and setting file permissions. To check its options, run:  `man install` 
- In our case:
   - `install -d` â†’ Creates the destination directory.
   - `install -m 0755` â†’ Copies the file and sets permissions (`rwxr-xr-x`).

### **13. Integrating Nano into Yocto**

### Method 1: Using GNU FTP (Nano 7.2)
For more details, visit: [Nano Releases](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/nano/).
- Navigate to your layer's `recipes-editors` directory:
   ```bash
      mkdir -p layers/meta-IVI/recipes-editors/nano
      cd layers/meta-IVI/recipes-editors/nano
   ```
- Create a recipe using `recipetool`:
   ```sh
      recipetool create -o nano_1.0.bb https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/nano/nano-7.2.tar.xz
   ```

- Build Nano using Bitbake:
   ```bash
      bitbake nano
   ```

---

### Method 2: Using the Official Git Repository (Nano 8.3)

For more details, visit: [Nano Git Repository](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/nano.git/tree/README.hacking).

- Install dependencies required for building Nano from source:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install autoconf automake autopoint gcc gettext git groff make pkg-config texinfo
   ```
- Create a recipe using `recipetool`:
   ```bash
   recipetool create -o nano_1.0.bb git://git.savannah.gnu.org/nano.git
   ```
- Fetch and unpack the source code:
   ```bash
   bitbake -c fetch nano
   bitbake -c unpack nano
   ```
   
- Find the `WORKDIR` path:
   ```bash
   bitbake -e nano | grep -i "^workdir="
   ```
   Navigate to the printed path.

- Run `autogen.sh` to generate the `configure` script:
   ```bash
   ./autogen.sh
   ```
We performed these two steps separately instead of running `bitbake nano` directly because:  

1. **Auto-configuration Requirement:**  
   - The source code from `git://git.savannah.gnu.org/nano.git` requires running `./autogen.sh` before `configure` can execute.  
   - `bitbake nano` by default runs the `do_configure` task, which expects a `configure` script to exist. But since `nano` uses `autogen.sh` to generate this script, `do_configure` would fail if we ran `bitbake nano` immediately.  

2. **Manual Execution of `autogen.sh`:**  
   - After `bitbake -c unpack nano`, we navigate to the work directory and manually run `./autogen.sh` to generate the necessary `configure` script.  
   - This ensures that the `do_configure` step in BitBake will succeed when we finally run `bitbake nano`.  


- Build Nano:
   ```bash
   bitbake nano
   ```
 **Automate this steps**
   **1. Patch `autogen.sh`**

   - The patch removes the Gnulib cloning logic from `autogen.sh`. Here's the patch:

   **2. Final Recipe for Nano**
   - Hereâ€™s the updated Yocto recipe that incorporates the patch and automates the build process:
      ```nano.bb
      SUMMARY = "GNU nano text editor"
      DESCRIPTION = "GNU nano is a small and simple text editor."
      HOMEPAGE = "https://www.nano-editor.org/"
      LICENSE = "GPL-3.0-only & Unknown"
      LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://COPYING;md5=f27defe1e96c2e1ecd4e0c9be8967949 \
                        file://COPYING.DOC;md5=ad1419ecc56e060eccf8184a87c4285f"
      SRC_URI = "git://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/nano.git;protocol=https;branch=master;name=nano \
               git://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/gnulib.git;protocol=https;branch=master;name=gnulib;destsuffix=git/gnulib \
               file://0001-remove-cloning-gnulib-by-script-autogen.patch"
      SRCREV_nano = "63a7be115a729190fdf612fd5b821ac015f2421e"
      SRCREV_gnulib = "4631e9b4d5d3bd5ba42864c7001cf3509a00c7b3"
      SRCREV_FORMAT = "nano_gnulib"
      PV = "1.0+git${SRCPV}"
      S = "${WORKDIR}/git"
      DEPENDS = "zlib ncurses file"
      inherit gettext pkgconfig autotools
      # Ensure gnulib is available in the source directory
      do_unpack_append() {
         cp -r ${WORKDIR}/git/gnulib ${S}/gnulib
      }
      # Run autogen.sh before configure
      do_autogen() {
         cd ${S}
         ./autogen.sh
      }
      addtask do_autogen before do_configure after do_unpack
      # Configure and build
      do_configure() {
         oe_runconf
      }
      do_build() {
         oe_runmake
      }

      # Disable package QA checks
      do_package_qa[noexec]="1"
      ```

#### **Explanation of the Recipe**
1. **`SRC_URI`**:
   - Fetches Nano and Gnulib from their respective Git repositories.
   - Includes the patch to modify `autogen.sh`.
   - When adding multiple Git repositories to `SRC_URI`, you must give each one a **unique name** using the `name` parameter.

2. **`SRCREV_name`**
   - specify the Git revision (spicail commit) for each repository

   **Note** If you forget to add `SRCREV_FORMAT`, Yocto will throw this error:
      ```
      Failure expanding variable SRCPV, expression was ${@bb.fetch2.get_srcrev(d)} which triggered exception
      FetchError: Fetcher failure: The SRCREV_FORMAT variable must be set when multiple SCMs are used.
      ```
3. **`SRCREV_FORMAT`**
   - To combine the `SRCREV` values into a single version string, you must define `SRCREV_FORMAT`

4. **`do_autogen`**:
   - Runs `autogen.sh` to generate the `configure` script.

5. **`addtask`**:
   - Ensures `do_autogen` runs before `do_configure`.

**Problem**
 The original `autogen.sh` script tries to clone Gnulib using a **private Git link**:
```bash
git clone <membername>@git.savannah.gnu.org:/srv/git/gnulib.git
```
- This requires **SSH authentication**, which is not suitable for a Yocto build environment.

then you have to replace the private link with a **public Git link**: [GNU Gnulib Git Repository](https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=gnulib)

```bitbake
SRC_URI = "git://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/gnulib.git;protocol=https;branch=master;name=gnulib;destsuffix=git/gnulib"
```
- This public link (`https`) doesnâ€™t require authentication and works seamlessly in Yocto.

### **14.  Steps to integrate `audio` in `meta-IVI` Layer**  
 
#### **Steps to Create `audio.bbclass` in `meta-IVI` Layer**  
- **Navigate to your layer directory & **Create the `classes/` directory if it doesnâ€™t exist::**  
   ```bash
   cd layers/meta-IVI
   mkdir -p classes
   touch classes/audio.bbclass
   ```
- **Edit the file and add the following content:**  
   ```audio.bbclass
   IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " pavucontrol pulseaudio pulseaudio-module-dbus-protocol pulseaudio-server \
                           pulseaudio-module-loopback pulseaudio-module-bluetooth-discover alsa-ucm-conf \
                           pulseaudio-module-bluetooth-policy alsa-topology-conf alsa-state alsa-lib alsa-tools \
                           pulseaudio-module-bluez5-device pulseaudio-module-bluez5-discover alsa-utils alsa-plugins bluez5 "
   ```
Once **`inherit audio`** is added to a recipe, all these packages will be automatically included in the **final image**.  

####  Or simply add the `alsa` and `pulseaudio` into the `DISTRO_FEATURES`


#### **`inc` vs. `bbclass` vs `require` in Yocto**  

 **(Include File):**  
- It is **included textually** in a recipe (`.bb`) during parsing, like a **copy-paste** operation.  
- Any modification **does not directly affect** the recipes that included it unless you run **`bitbake -c clean <package>`** and rebuild.  
- `include` is used to **insert the contents of another file** into the current recipe or configuration file.
- The included file can be a `.inc` file, a `.bb` file, or any other file with valid BitBake syntax.
- Use **`include`** when you want to reuse **configurations** or **variables** from another file, but itâ€™s optional.
- Used for **shared settings** across multiple recipes, but without the need for inheritance (`inherit`).  

 **(Class File):**  
- It is **inherited** in recipes (`inherit audio`), and its content is **executed at build time**, not just included.  
- Any modification **immediately affects all recipes** that inherit it, without needing a `clean` operation.  
- Used when there is **common build logic**, such as `kernel.bbclass` ,`autotools`, `cmake` or `image.bbclass`.
- `inherit` is used to **inherit classes** in BitBake.
- Classes are files (`.bbclass`) that contain common functionality that can be reused across multiple recipes.

 **`require` in BitBake Recipes**  
The `require` directive in BitBake is used to **include the contents of another file** into the current recipe **at parse time**. It is similar to copy-pasting the content of the required file directly into the current file.   
- **Directly Includes Another File** â†’ The contents of the required file are inserted into the recipe as if they were written there.  
- **Used for Sharing Common Configurations** â†’ Useful when multiple recipes need the same settings.  
- **File Must Exist** â†’ If the required file is missing, BitBake will throw an error.  


**`inherit` is used to reuse **build logic**, **while `include` and `require` are used to reuse **configurations** or **variables**.



#### **Table with BitBake's Perspective**  

| Keyword   | Purpose                 | BitBake's Perspective               | Behavior if File/Class is Missing | Commonly Used For         |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `inherit` | Inherit functionality from a class (`.bbclass`).                       | Extends the recipe by executing functions from the class. | Error (class not found).          | Reusing build logic (e.g., `autotools`).  |
| `include` | Insert the contents of another file (`.inc`, `.bb`, etc.).             | Parses the included file but does not enforce its presence. | Silent (no error).                | Reusing configurations or variables.       |
| `require` | Insert the contents of another file, but raise an error if not found.  | Parses and strictly enforces the required file's presence. | Error (file not found).           | Enforcing the presence of critical files.  |

### **15. rpiplay**


###  Steps for **RPiPlay** Integration  

- **Create the initial recipe**  
   ```bash
      mkdir -p layers/meta-IVI/recipes-rpiplay
      cd layers/meta-IVI/recipes-rpiplay
      recipetool create -o rpi-play_1.0.bb https://github.com/FD-/RPiPlay.git
   ```
   - This generates a base `.bb` file, but **itâ€™s not reliable** because it misses dependencies.  

- **Find missing dependencies**  
   - Checked the **GitHub repository** for required libraries [RPiPlay GitHub](https://github.com/FD-/RPiPlay) .
   - Manually searched for them in **OpenEmbedded Layer Index** [OpenEmbedded Layer Index - Kirkstone Recipes](https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/kirkstone/recipes/).  

- **Add the missing layer (`meta-networking`)**  
   - Since `avahi` is in `meta-openembedded/meta-networking` , we **must add that layer** to `bblayers.conf`:
      ```bash
      bitbake-layers layerindex-show-depends meta-networking # it shows that it needs (openembededdcore , meta-oe and meta-pyhthon)  
      bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/meta-openembedded/meta-python
      bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/meta-openembedded/meta-networking
      ```

Before applying a patch, letâ€™s first **trigger the error** by running:  

```bash
bitbake rpi-play
```

**Expected Error:**
```terminal output 
CMake Error at renderers/CMakeLists.txt:43 (add_library):
  No SOURCES given to target: ilclient
```


#### **Debugging the Missing `ilclient` Library Issue**  

- **Step 1: Understanding `ilclient`**  
Before fixing anything, we need to understand what **`ilclient`** is.  
   - A quick **Google search** tells us that `ilclient` is part of the **Userland** library.  [ilclient.h GitHub](https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland/blob/master/host_applications/linux/apps/hello_pi/libs/ilclient/ilclient.h)
   - Userland is a set of **Raspberry Pi-specific** libraries that provide access to the VideoCore hardware (e.g., OpenGL, camera, and multimedia processing).  

- **Step 2: Check if `ilclient` is Present**  
Since `ilclient` should come from `userland`, we need to **verify if it exists in the sysroot**.  

   - **Find the Work Directory for `rpi-play`**  
      ```bash
         bitbake -e rpi-play | grep "^WORKDIR="
      ```
   - This will output something like:  
      ```bash
         WORKDIR="/home/mohamed/Documents/Mastering_Embedded_Linux/5-Yocto/build-raspberrypi4/tmp-glibc/work/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4-oe-linux-gnueabi/rpi-play/1.2+gitAUTOINC+64d0341ed3-r0"
      ```

   - **Navigate to the sysroot**  
      ```bash
         # sysroot of the rpi-play
         cd /home/mohamed/Documents/Mastering_Embedded_Linux/5-Yocto/build-raspberrypi4/tmp-glibc/work/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4-oe-linux-gnueabi/rpi-play/1.2+gitAUTOINC+64d0341ed3-r0/recipe-sysroot
      ```

   - **Search for `ilclient`**  
      ```bash
         find . -name "*ilclient*"
      ```
   **Expected Output:**  
   - If `ilclient` **is present**, we should see something like:  
      ```sh
         ./usr/src/path/ilclient.h
         ./usr/src/path/libilclient.so
      ```
   - If **no results** appear, that means `ilclient` is **missing**.  



- **Step 3: Identify Why `ilclient` is Missing**  
   Since `ilclient` comes from `userland`, it should be present in our sysroot. We need to check whether `userland` is:  
      1. **Not included in DEPENDS** (so it wasnâ€™t built).  
      2. **Installed incorrectly** (so it didnâ€™t provide `ilclient`).  

   Letâ€™s check the `DEPENDS` in our recipe:  
   ```rpi-play.bb
   DEPENDS = "userland openssl avahi mdns libplist gstreamer1.0 gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-vaapi gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad"
   ```
   - **`userland` is already listed!**  

   - But letâ€™s confirm it was actually built:  
      ```bash
      bitbake -e userland | grep "^WORKDIR="
      ```
   - If `WORKDIR` is found, then `userland` **was built**.  
   - If itâ€™s missing, we need to `bitbake userland` separately.  

- **Step 4: Manually Verify `/opt/vc` Inside `userland`**  
Since the `RPiPlay` repo expects `ilclient` inside `/opt/vc`, we need to check:  

   ```bash
   #  # the working ditectory of userland
   cd /home/mohamed/Documents/Mastering_Embedded_Linux/5-Yocto/build-raspberrypi4/tmp-glibc/work/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4-oe-linux-gnueabi/userland/20220323-r0/image"
   find . -name "*ilclient*"
   ```
   We see that `ilclient` **exists**, but in a different location:  
      ``` terminal output 
      $ find . -name "*ilclient*"
      ./usr/src/hello_pi/libs/ilclient
      ./usr/src/hello_pi/libs/ilclient/ilclient.h
      ./usr/src/hello_pi/libs/ilclient/ilclient.c
      ```
   This is **not** where `RPiPlay` expects it to be.  
      - If `/opt/vc` **exists and contains `ilclient`**, we need to **correct the CMake paths**. 
      - If it doesnâ€™t exist, then userland wasnâ€™t built properly or needs extra install steps or it built correctly but it's install the output in other place `/usr/` insted of `/opt/vc` .

**How does `bitbake` handle dependencies?**  
When `bitbake` builds `rpi-play`, it pulls dependencies from the `sysroot` of its dependencies (like `userland`).
 But in this case, **`userland` installs `ilclient` locally inside its own `image/` directory, and not in the `sysroot`**, so `RPiPlay` can't find it.  


- **Step 5: Possible Solutions and Why They Won't Work**  
  - **Manually copying `ilclient`**  Copying files manually into `sysroot` is not a scalable solution and goes against Yocto's clean design. 
   
  - **The Proper Fix â€“ Patching CMake + Adjusting `userland` Sysroot**  
   - **Fix 1: Ensure `ilclient` is Available in the `sysroot`**  
	Since `userland` installs `ilclient` **inside its own image directory but not in `sysroot`**, we need to tell Yocto to include `/usr/src/hello_pi/libs` in the `sysroot` of rpiplay.  

      1.  Create a `userland.bbappend` file inside our meta-layer:  
         
      ```sh
         mkdir -p meta-IVI/recipes-graphics/userland/
         touch meta-IVI/recipes-graphics/userland/userland_git.bbappend
      ```
      2. Add the following line inside `userland_git.bbappend`:  

      ```userland_git.bbappend
      SYSROOT_DIRS:append="${prefix}/src"
      ```
      ðŸ”¹ **Why?** This ensures that `/usr/src/hello_pi/libs` is **copied into the sysroot**, making `ilclient` available for `rpi-play`.  

   - **Fix 2: Patch `CMakeLists.txt`**  Instead of `/opt/vc`, `CMakeLists.txt` should look in `/usr/src/hello_pi/libs`.  

      1. Navigate to the `rpi-play` source directory after unpacking:  
         ```bash
         #  the path of working directory of the rpi-play
            cd /home/mohamed/Documents/Mastering_Embedded_Linux/5-Yocto/build-raspberrypi4/tmp-glibc/work/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4-oe-linux-gnueabi/rpi-play/1.0-r0/git/
         ```
      2. Modify `renders/CMakeLists.txt` to replace `/opt/vc` with `/usr/`.  
      3. Generate a patch i recommend to make the patch file inside the `devshell`:  [concepts of diff and patch in YouTube](https://youtu.be/-s13A9MPmGU?si=levSHq4tF5SXgctj)
         ```patch
            bitbake -c devshell rpi-play # it will open other terminal that simulate the target environments . 
            # change each  `/opt/vc` you see with  `/usr/` insted of it .
            git diff > 0001_include_dir.patch
         ```
         the patch file content if you cannot make it

#### **`Depends` vs `RDEPENDS_${PN}`**
**Runtime Libraries** are the shared libraries a program needs **while running**, whereas **Build-time (Development) Libraries** are required **only during compilation**. Build-time libraries (e.g., `libssl-dev`, `libplist-dev`) include header files (`.h`) and static libraries needed to compile software, while runtime libraries (e.g., `libssl`, `libplist`) contain shared objects (`.so`) that the program dynamically links to during execution.  

For example, if a program uses OpenSSL, it requires `libssl-dev` at **build-time** to provide necessary headers, but at **runtime**, it only needs `libssl.so` to function properly. In Yocto, dependencies are managed accordingly: `DEPENDS` includes build-time packages, while `RDEPENDS_${PN}` ensures runtime dependencies are available in the final system.

**Note:** How to determine the runtime dependencies of a package in **Yocto (Poky/ConTe Yocto variant)**?  
You can run the following command:  
   ```bash
   $ readelf -d rpiplay | grep -i needed
   # This will list all the shared libraries (`.so` files) required by the binary. Based on this output, you can decide which packages to include in the `RDEPENDS_${PN}` variable. 

   # Example output:
   0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libplist-2.0.so.3]
   0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libcrypto.so.3]
   0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libdns_sd.so.1]
   0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libopenmaxil.so]
   0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libbcm_host.so]
   0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libvcos.so]
   0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libgstapp-1.0.so.0]
   0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libgstreamer-1.0.so.0]
   0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libgobject-2.0.so.0]
   0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libglib-2.0.so.0]
   0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libstdc++.so.6]
   0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libm.so.6]
   0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libgcc_s.so.1]
   0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libc.so.6]
   0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libvchostif.so]
   ```

#### *Example `RDEPENDS_${PN}`:*
   ```rpi-play.bb
   RDEPENDS_${PN} = "avahi libplist gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good"
   ```
   This ensures that the necessary runtime dependencies are available when the package is installed.  

**Note:**  These two lines modify the **linking behavior** in a Yocto recipe:  
```rpi-play.bb
TARGET_LDFLAGS += "-Wl,--copy-dt-needed-entries"
EXTRA_OEMAKE:append = ' LDFLAGS="${TARGET_LDFLAGS}"'
```

1. **`-Wl,--copy-dt-needed-entries`**  
   - Ensures that **indirect shared library dependencies** are included in the final binary.  
   - Without it, only directly linked libraries are included, which can cause **runtime errors** if an intermediate library is missing.  

2. **`EXTRA_OEMAKE:append = ' LDFLAGS="${TARGET_LDFLAGS}"'`**  
   - Passes `TARGET_LDFLAGS` to `make`, ensuring the linker flag is applied during the build.  



- **Step 6: Rebuilding and Testing**  

   - Rebuild `rpi-play` with the patched CMakeLists.txt:  
      ```bash
      bitbake -c cleanall rpi-play
      bitbake rpi-play
      ```
   - Verify that `ilclient` is now present in the `sysroot`:  
      ```bash
         # the working ditectory of rpi-play 
         find /home/mohamed/Documents/Mastering_Embedded_Linux/5-Yocto/build-raspberrypi4/tmp-glibc/work/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4-oe-linux-gnueabi/rpi-play/1.0-r0/recipe-sysroot/ -name "*ilclient*"
      ```

#### **Difference Between `bitbake -c clean`, `cleanall`, and `cleansstate`**  
In **BitBake**, the `clean`, `cleansstate`, and `cleanall` commands are used to clean up build artifacts, but they differ in **scope** and **what they remove**. Understanding these differences is important for managing your build environment effectively.

- **`bitbake -c clean <recipe>`**  
  â†’ Deletes `WORKDIR` (temporary build files `tmp/work/`) but keeps downloads and sstate cache.  
  
- **`bitbake -c cleansstate <recipe>`**  
  â†’  Deletes `WORKDIR` (`tmp/work/`) and shared state (`sstate-cache/`) cache but keeps downloads. Forces re-execution of tasks that use sstate (e.g., configure, compile).  
  
- **`bitbake -c cleanall <recipe>`**  
  â†’ Deletes `WORKDIR` (`tmp/work/` ), source downloads( `downloads/` ), and sstate cache( `sstate-cache/` ). Equivalent to a fresh start for that recipe.  



#### **Comparison Table**

| Command          | Removes Working Directory | Removes Shared State Cache | Removes Downloaded Sources | Scope                     |
|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| `clean`          | Yes                       | No                         | No                         | Recipe-specific           |
| `cleansstate`    | Yes                       | Yes                        | No                         | Recipe-specific           |
| `cleanall`       | Yes                       | Yes                        | Yes                        | Recipe-specific           |

### **16. VSOMEIP Integration with Yocto (Kirkstone)**    

**VSOMEIP** is an open-source implementation of **SOME/IP (Scalable service-Oriented Middleware over IP)** used in automotive Ethernet-based communication. It enables service-oriented communication between ECUs (Electronic Control Units) following the **AUTOSAR** standard.  


- **Common Issues & Solutions**  

   Many users report errors like: [vsomeip GitHub Issue #362](https://github.com/COVESA/vsomeip/issues/362)  
   ```
   basic_socket_ext_local.hpp:133:7: error: no matching function for call to 'boost::asio::detail::io_object_impl<boost::asio::detail::reactive_socket_service_ext_local<boost::asio::local::stream_protocol_ext, boost::asio::executor>::io_object_impl(boost::asio::io_context&)'
   ```  
   This typically occurs due to **incompatibility between VSOMEIP and Boost versions**.  
   The best working **Boost version** for **VSOMEIP** on **Yocto Kirkstone** is:  `  Boost 1.71`
   Later versions cause the compilation to fail due to breaking changes in **Boost.Asio**.  so that you have to install [recipes-support (boost files)](https://github.com/COVESA/vsomeip/files/9394162/recipes-support.zip) in your layer and give it higher prority than the `meta`  

- **Setting Up VSOMEIP in Yocto**  
      Since **VSOMEIP** has dependencies and conflicts with some existing packages, it's essential to ensure the custom layer has a higher priority than **meta**. Modify `local.conf` or add to `layer.conf`:  
      ```sh
      BBFILE_PRIORITY_meta-IVI = "8"
      ```  

- **VSOMEIP Recipe for Yocto (Kirkstone)**  
   
   - create the following directory structure inside your custom layer:  
      ```bash
      mkdir -p layers/meta-IVI/recipes-connectivity/vsomeip
      ```

   - Then, create the **Bitbake recipe** file inside this directory and add the following content:  
      ```bitbake
      SUMMARY = "The implementation of SOME/IP"
      SECTION = "base"
      LICENSE = "MPLv2"
      LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://LICENSE;md5=815ca599c9df247a0c7f619bab123dad"

      DEPENDS = "boost dlt-daemon"
      FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}:"

      SRC_URI = "git://github.com/GENIVI/${BPN}.git;protocol=https"

      S = "${WORKDIR}/git"

      inherit cmake lib_package gitpkgv

      PACKAGES:remove = "${PN}-bin"
      FILES:${PN} += "${bindir}/vsomeipd ${sysconfdir}/${BPN}"
      FILES:${PN}-dev += "${libdir}/cmake"

      BBCLASSEXTEND = "nativesdk"

      do_install:append() {
         mv ${D}/usr/etc ${D}
      }
      ```

```

### **20. Enabling Video Output on Raspberry Pi 4**  

After booting into the image and testing everything, **RPiPlay wasn't displaying anything on the Raspberry Pi 4**, even though it worked on other platforms.  

#### **Investigating the Issue**  
 RPiPlay was originally designed for **Raspberry Pi 3**, and the video driver setup differs between Pi 3 and Pi 4.  
 The **default video driver settings** in `config.txt` were likely incompatible with Pi 4, preventing video output.  

#### **Solution: Update `config.txt` for Raspberry Pi 4**  
   1. **To enable proper video rendering on RPi 4**
   we need to modify `/boot/config.txt` by adding the following lines and remove the older `dtoverlay` :  
      ```config.txt
      # Enable DRM VC4 V3D driver on top of the dispmanx display stack
      dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d
      max_framebuffers=2
      ```
       **Why does this work?**  
         - `vc4-fkms-v3d` enables the **Fake KMS (FKMS) driver**, allowing OpenGL acceleration while maintaining compatibility with legacy display stacks.  
         - `max_framebuffers=2` ensures enough framebuffers are available for smooth rendering.  

   
   2.  **Reboot the system**: 
            ```
            sudo reboot
            ```
   3. **Run RPiPlay again**, and now video output should work properly!
